  {name: "Key Elements in the Results Monitoring Plan", body: "<p><em><strong>Performance Indicator:</strong></em>Indicators are measures used to gauge progress toward the project’s intended outcomes and objectives. &nbsp;The indicators listed in the RMP template have been copied directly from the SoW and cannot be changed by the implementer without NEA/AC approval.</p><p><strong><em>Definition:&nbsp;</em>&nbsp;</strong>Under “Definition,” describe all the key terms in the indicator, so that the implementer and NEA/AC can understand precisely what will be counted as a success and what will not. &nbsp;If percentages or ratios are to be used, identify precisely the numerator and the denominator to be used in calculating the number. &nbsp;For qualitative indicators, give as complete and precise a definition of the conditions that will represent a “yes” or “no” in a yes/no type of indicator, or be observed and judged to represent achievement or stages of progress toward achievement of the Outcome or Objective in that type of indicator. &nbsp;If using a scorecard, milestone scale, index, or other similar tool, reference the tool you will use. That tool should be discussed and agreed upon with the NEA/AC program officer, and provided as an attachment to the SoW.</p><p><strong><em>Baseline Date and Baseline Value:</em></strong>Under “Baseline Date” and “Baseline Value,” identify the date when actual baseline data were collected, and the value. &nbsp;The baseline is the initial measurement of an indicator at the start of the project. For example, a project that aims to increase the number of local firms exporting to the United States should measure the number of such firms at the beginning of the project, in order to measure progress over the course of the project. For quantitative indicators, the number/percentage/etc. noted under “Unit of Measure” should be stated. &nbsp;The baseline is often zero and, if so, “0” should be entered. &nbsp;For qualitative indicators, the baseline conditions should be described (per the terms provided in the Indicator Definition).</p><p>Ideally, the baseline data can be collected or acquired from a secondary source (such as a ministry) for a period as close to the beginning of the project as possible, in order to get a clear picture of the status of the Outcome or Objective indicator before the project’s interventions. &nbsp;If no pre-project baseline data are available, they should be collected as soon after the start of the project as possible.</p><p><strong><em>Target: &nbsp;</em></strong>Under “Target,” place the expected value you hope to reach, and by when you hope to reach it4. If no target is used, enter “n/a.” &nbsp;The target value may be a final number (e.g., 100 judges trained; a rating of 4.5 on an agreed-upon index; etc.). &nbsp;There may also be intermediate targets (e.g., 30 judges trained after six months; 60 judges trained after one year).</p><p><em><strong>Unit of Measure:</strong></em> Under “Unit of Measure,” identify the unit used (e.g., number of firms, percent, yes/no, dollars, index score, average, etc.). &nbsp;Using number and percent together is recommended where possible. &nbsp;For instance, five local firms exporting to the United States may be very significant if there are only ten local firms, but relatively insignificant if there are 300 local firms. &nbsp;Providing information such as “5 firms/25% of total firms” gives a good picture of program impact, on an absolute and relative level.</p><p><strong><em>Reporting Frequency: &nbsp;</em></strong>Under “Reporting Frequency,” identify how often the data will be reported (e.g., quarterly, yearly, etc.)</p><p><strong><em>Data Source and Collection Method:</em>&nbsp;</strong>Under “Data Source and Collection Method,” identify the source of the data to be collected and used to calculate the value of a quantitative indicator (e.g., Ministry of records; raining registration forms; records completed by project staff; a survey of activists) or to decide whether a qualitative condition has or has not been achieved (e.g., direct observations made by project staff, self-reported conditions by assisted NGOs). &nbsp;Also identify how the data will be collected and analyzed. &nbsp;If using a survey, who will be surveyed? How will the subjects be identified? How will the survey be conducted? &nbsp;If using an index, what indicators are included and how is the index calculated? How will the scores be compiled? &nbsp;Again, if using an index, baseline scorecard, or similar tool, that tool should be referenced here after being discussed and agreed upon with a NEA/AC program officer (and attached to the SoW). &nbsp;This information is critically important for data collectors, because in the event that someone leaves the project, their replacement will be able to read this information and know exactly what to do. &nbsp;It is also important for any new program or grants officers in NEA/AC.</p><p><em><strong>NOTE:</strong>&nbsp;</em>For some indicators, it may not be advisable to have a target; this should be determined in consultation with NEA/AC. &nbsp;</p><p><strong><em>Person/Unit Responsible for Reporting: &nbsp;</em></strong>Under “Person/Unit Responsible for Reporting,” identify who is specifically responsible for data reporting for the Quarterly Report.</p><p><em><strong>Comments/Concerns:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</em>Under “Comments/Concerns,” identify anything worth noting that has not already been discussed elsewhere.</p>", ordernum: 35.0, level_id: 2, image_file_name: "acprs_editindicator.jpg", image_content_type: "image/jpeg", image_file_size: 111046, image_updated_at: "2016-03-23 03:08:12", imageset: 2, caption: "Input form for custom project-specific indicators", oldorder: 35.0, adminnotes: "", book: 0, toc1: nil, toc2: nil, toc3: nil},

A sample QR template can be seen in Annex I.</p><p>Unless there is an overdue QR from a previous quarter, the active (current) quarter will display a link to edit the current QR and a link to submit the completed QR for the active period.

The first section is to update activities. &nbsp;For the QPR update users can either provide an actual date for the activity completion or a revised completion date if the activity will not be completed during the period when it was planned. &nbsp;The Program Officer will review these requested dates after QPR submission. <br><br>The project officer reviews the requested date changes as part of the review and approval of the QPR. &nbsp;If the project officer approves the revisions, they will be saved to the ACPRS when the PO approves the QR. &nbsp;The revised dates will appear in future QRs in the quarterly report template so that the implementer can report against them. &nbsp;If the PO has concerns about the requested revised dates, s/he may choose to follow up further with the implementer. &nbsp;If the PO and implementer determine that the date should not be changed after all or a different target date selected, the implementer will need to enter the revised date and re-submit the quarterly report for approval. &nbsp;The user should enter actual completion dates for any activities completed during the quarter.<br><br>The Discussion of Work plan Progress section at the bottom of each objective allows implementers to provide a narrative summary of activities during the reporting period in question. &nbsp;Implementers should include an explanation of any delays or obstacles encountered, and their plans to address them, note any activities that progressed exceptionally well, and explain requests for new completion dates.</p>", ordernum: 46.0, level_id: 3, image_file_name: nil, image_content_type: nil, image_file_size: nil, image_updated_at: nil, imageset: nil, caption: "", oldorder: 46.0, adminnotes: "", book: 0, toc1: nil, toc2: nil, toc3: nil},
